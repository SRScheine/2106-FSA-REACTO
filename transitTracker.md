Design a Public Transit Tracker ðŸ›¤ðŸš‚
Back story
OOP Design (object-oriented programming) is a good exercise to show how to split up our system into different components. You can think of React Components but instead, we are separating our system into different objects/classes. The important factor of this problem and problems like these are that they are opened ended and force you to think abstractly and creatively. The main goal of this exercise is to be able to draw out diagrams to communicate abstract ideas before they begin to be implemented with code.

These problems are language agnostic (meaning language-neutral, or cross-language)

Learning Objective
To understand and design activity diagrams and class diagrams.
The prompt
A major city has finally realized how beneficial it would be for it's citizens to be able to track public transit and see how far away their next ride is! The city has placed you in charge of designing the system!

The mayor's requirement
The consumers need to be able to get information about the location of the buses and trains in relation to which stop they request via SMS text message and via a website. They both will communicate with the API indicated below.
What information is given to us by the mayor? (provide to interviewee)
Each bus/train has a GPS tracker on it that will automatically send an HTTP request every minute with configurable data to the database.
Our system is able to send SMS messages with a single function call by first, converting the SMS to an HTTP request, then waiting for a response from the server, and finally converting the response back to an SMS text message.
Each run has a specific id associated with it, which includes information about the vehicle and the route that the vehicle is completing. (ie. #8528 is a specific vehicle completing a Blue Line run)
Task of interviewee
Contemplate and diagram the different 'components' of this public transit tracker including:

Activity Diagrams (User Stories)
specifically an activity diagram is an advanced version of flow chart that models the flow from one activity to another activity, but very similar to a user story
System Data Flow Diagram (Can be a substitute for the Activity Diagrams)
the way information flows through a process or systems
Class Diagram
show the different objects in a system, their attributes, their operations and the relationships among them.
(Focus should be on the first 2 and if there is any extra time, go through to the class and the schema located at the bottom of this gist)

We can assume that the public transit system is made up of buses and subway/trains only. The Major has given you access to the following routes:

GET /:stopId
request body: {route: xxx, stopId: xxx, include active runs on that route where distance in time from stop < 30 mins }
response body: {buses that meet the criteria and remaining minutes until they reach the stop}

    *if the request is coming from an SMS text message, it will first be converted into an HTTP request

PUT /routes / id
request body: {route: req.params.id, status: out of service}

PUT vehicle/ id
request body: {vehicle: req.params.id, status: out of service}
City

INTERVIEWER TIPS
There are several edge cases and challenges that your interviewee should consider (again the purpose is for them to think abstractly and creatively). Here are some questions that you can should ask to help them along that process:

What are the "nouns" associated with this system? (nouns will help the identify the parts of the system)
What are the "verbs" associated with this sytem? (what kind of actions does the mayor want to take place)
What happens when a bus/train needs to re-route, skip a stop, or if the route is out of service? (edge cases)
How is this different from designing something like Venmo? (The main users are just people making payments to each other, as opposed to the many different users of this system [drivers, dispatches, users])
If your interviewee is stuck, start by discussing the nouns and verbs listed below, and then talk through the user stories listed below.

Interviewee can use creately to create their diagram you can send them a link to access by clicking here

POSSIBLE SOLUTION â†“
Nouns:

Routes
Vehicle (bus or traincar)
Runs (ie #4567 would be a specific vehicle completing a route)
Stops
GPS locator on each vehicle
Verbs:

Start a run - info needed: vehicle, route, and run number
Location and time updated once per minute
Calculate distance in time to the next stop
if the time is less than 1 minute, display "due" instead
Handle service changes, such as:
delays
express routes in which vehicles skip stops
Vehicle breaks down and is now out of service
ReRoute
a run has to take a different route due to construction, etc.
Individual User Stories (option 1)
If the candidate seems stuck, then the individual stories would be best suited to help attempt to get them along.

Below are examples of both diagrams as well as written stories

Users:

SMS Text Request: (written) Each bus stop has a sign with information about which buses stop there, what time routes run, a bus stop id number, and phone number that users can text to receive information about which buses are scheduled to arrive within the next 30 minutes. The user will send a text to the number listed on the sign with a 4 digit code specific to the bus stop that they would like to receive information about. The user receives an SMS response with the list of buses approaching that stop within in the next 30 minutes.
SMS Diagram (conceptual) SMSRiderStory

Transit Tracker App or Website: (written) The user has an app on their phone or is using a website to view a list of upcoming buses or trains that are approaching. The user navigates to a "View Stops" page and selects their stop from a list of all stops. The user is redirected to a list view of all approaching buses or trains within the next 30 minutes. Each bus/train listed has information about which direction it's headed, as well as how many minutes until it arrives at the stop.

System Admins:

3.All vehicles on a route are re-routed due to construction: (written) The system administrator is notified that a route will be closed due to construction, which means that any bus/trains that normally use that route will have to be re-routed(aka assigned a new route). The system administrator navigates to that vehicle and clicks the "out of service" button. The system admin can select which route the buses/trains will be re-routed to.

Re-route Diagram (conceptual) DispatcherStory

4.A bus/train has broken down, and is no longer in service: (written) The conductor or drive realizes that the vehicle cannot operate anymore, and notifies the control center that the vehicle cannot complete the route. The system administrator uses the admin portal to navigate to the specific run, and clicks the "out of service" button, which removes the vehicle from service.

The Data Flow Diagram (option 2)
The Data Flow Diagram would be acceptable as a substitute to all the individual user stories as it is a combination of all the user stories in one functioning system.

Class Diagram Guidance
Use the nouns and verbs to help the candidate with this. The important parts of the class diagram are:

Users
Driver extends Users
Dispatcher extends Users
Reason: We want to talk about how to use inheritance here to have a base class and subclasses of that base class
Vehicle
VehicleDashboard is part of Vehicle
GPS is part of Vehicle
Reason for above two: We want to talk about object composition. If we extended GPS from Vehicle, it would cause tight coupling of things that are best composed since while they are related, a GPS (or Vehicle Dashboard) is not a "version" of a Vehicle. It is just a part of it.
Train extends Vehicle
Bus extends Vehicle
Reason for above two: Same reason as the Dispatcher and Driver extending Users
Admin Dashboard
Notification To Rider

Below is if you have time or any interest in what a schema for the Mayors problem could look like:
DB Schema
There is a many-to-many relationship between vehicles and routes.
The schedule/runs have data that are not exclusive to either vehciles or routes but are associated with both so that info goes in a through table.
The main associations are:
Vehicles and Routes have a many-to-many relationship with each other through Runs
Routes and Stops have a many-to-many relationship with each other through the RouteStops through table
