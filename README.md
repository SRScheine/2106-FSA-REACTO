# 2106-FSA REACTO Exercises

Hi everyone! In this repo you can find two (sometimes three) things in each file:

1. The link to the gist from the fellow-run REACTO
2. The raw text copied from the gist
3. An attempt at a solution from me (rare, probably not the optimal solution lol)

Good luck with your Algo studying!
